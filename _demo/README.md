# Demos

## Running the demos

Although the components and demos use the node toolchain, the generated demo files run standalone in a browser.


* Open the demo/xxx/index.html in your browser


## Modifying the demos

Install the Node dependencies by running `npm install` in the root folder.



In the demo directory:

* To create a compressed file: `webpack`

or

* To update the file while working: `webpack -watch`
