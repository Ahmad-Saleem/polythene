## Getting started

### Under development

Version 1.0 is not yet in the npm registry. Currently you can use the branch `rewrite-universal`.

An example project setup is available at [polythene-mithril-rewrite-branch-starter](https://github.com/ArthurClemens/polythene-mithril-rewrite-branch-starter). This uses Webpack's resolve/alias configuration setting to point the package.json entry to the Polythene rewrite branch.
