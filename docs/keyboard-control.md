# Turning on keyboard control

Polythene supports navigation by keyboard, but often browsers need to be set up properly.

## Chrome

* Go to Settings > Appearance
  * Turn on: "Pressing Tab on a web page highlights links, as well as form fields"

## Safari (MacOS)

Safari on Mac does not give focus to links when they have a `href`. To turn on expected behavior:

* Go to Preferences > Tab Advanced
  * Under Accessibility, check "Press Tab to highlight each item on a webpage"

## Firefox on Mac

* Go to Preferences > Advanced > General
  * Uncheck "Always use the cursor keys to navigate within pages"
* Open your Mac's System Preferences
  * Go to Keyboard > Shortcuts
  * Select radio button  "All Controls"
